		<B>Introduction</B>
	</P>
	<P>
		The main documentation of the KANJIDIC2.XML is included in the DTD
		as comments. This page is just intended as a summary, and may not always be
		up-to-date.
	</P>
	<P>
		The KANJIDIC2 file has the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208, the
		5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212 and the 3,625 kanji from JIS X 0213 (of
		which all but 884 are also in JIS X 0212).
	</P>
	<P>
		At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
		with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
		equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.
	</P>
	<P>
		The
		<a HREF="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic_doc.html">KANJIDIC documentation </a>
		should also be read for additional information about the information in the
		file. It also contains information on the

				</LI>
				<LI>ucs - Unicode 4.0 - hex coding (4 or 5 hexadecimal digits)
				</LI>
			</UL>

		<LI>the radical.
			<UL>
				<LI>classical - as recorded in the KangXi Zidian.
				</LI>
				<LI>nelson - as used in the Nelson "Modern Japanese-English
					Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson).
					This will only be used where Nelson reclassified the kanji.

			</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>miscellaneous information.
			<UL>
				<LI>The Jouyou Kanji grade level. 1 through 6 indicate the grade in which
					the kanji is taught in Japanese schools. 8 indicates it is one of the
					remaining Jouyou Kanji to be learned in junior high school, and 9
					indicates it is a Jinmeiyou (for use in names) kanji. [G]
				</LI>
				<LI>The stroke count of the kanji, including the radical. If more than
					one, the first is considered the accepted count, while subsequent ones
					are common miscounts. (See Appendix E. of the KANJIDIC documentation
					for some of the rules applied when counting strokes in some of the
					radicals.) [S]
				</LI>
				<LI>A cross-reference code to another kanji, usually regarded as a variant.
					<UL>

				<LI>A frequency-of-use ranking. The 2,500 most-used characters have a
					ranking; those characters that lack this field are not ranked. The
					frequency is a number from 1 to 2,500 that expresses the relative
					frequency of occurrence of a character in modern Japanese.
					This is based on a survey in newspapers, so it is biassed towards kanji
					used in newspaper articles. The discrimination between the less
					frequently used kanji is not strong.
